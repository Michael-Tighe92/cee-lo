# cee-lo
A dice game where the goal is to win 5 rounds in order to win the match against the CPU. The rules are as follows:
1.) You or CPU must reach 5 wins in order to end the game
2.) At the start of the game there is a coin toss to determine who goes first
3.) After each round alternate who goes first
4.) Getting a roll of 4-5-6 is an automatic win
5.) Getting a roll of 1-2-3 is an automatic loss
6.) Getting a roll with three of the same numbers (three of a kind) is considered a triple and is higher than a point
7.) Getting a roll with two of the same numbers (pair) is consider a point. The die with the number not within the pair is the point
8.) Getting a point does not take into consideration of how high the pair is only the point. Ex: 1-1-6 is higher than 6-6-1
9.) Getting any roll besides the above mentioned will result in a meaningless roll. The player or CPU than must roll again
10.) Draws do not count as either a win or loss
